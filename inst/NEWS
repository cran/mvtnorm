\section{Changes in Version 1.2-0 (2023-06-02)}{
  \itemize{
    \item New \code{lpmvnorm} function for computing multivariate normal log-likelihoods for interval-censored observations.
    \item New \code{slpmvnorm} function for computing the corresponding score function for interval-censored observations.
    \item New \code{ldmvnorm} function for computing multivariate normal log-likelihoods for exact observations.
    \item New \code{sldmvnorm} function for computing the corresponding score function for exact observations.
    \item New \code{ldpmvnorm} function for computing multivariate normal log-likelihoods for a mix of exact and interval-censored observations.
    \item New \code{sldpmvnorm} function for computing the corresponding score function for a mix of exact and interval-censored observations.
    \item New class \code{ltMatrices} representing multiple lower triangular matrices, with some useful methods.
    \item New package vignette \code{lmvnorm_src} describing these new features.
    \item \code{pmvnorm}, \code{qmvnorm}, \code{pmvt}, and \code{qmvt} gain a \code{seed} argument.
    \item Regression tests were improved.
    \item Internal standardization is described better in the docs, suggested by Chris Wymant.
    \item New \code{NEWS} file, the old file containing information up to version 1.1-3 is available as \code{NEWS.old}.
